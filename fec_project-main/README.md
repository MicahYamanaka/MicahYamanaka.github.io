For your final project, web-host a data visualization created using a data structure (or not, but probably using one).

This repository is a sample project for CS 241.  The corresponding page is here: https://cd-public.github.io/fec_project/

# Step 1

Make a Github repository for your project. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo

I recommend just starting with this repository. You should be able to make a branch or copy the starting code.

# Step 2

Configure your repository to be a github.io page.  Look at "project site".  https://pages.github.com/

# Step 3

Find a data set. I like FEC data, but you don't have to use that.

# Step 4

Create a visualization.  I recommend the following sub-steps:

### Step 4.1

Select and use a data structure to read the data

### Step 4.2

Convert the data structure to a data frame.

### Step 4.3

Use Seaborn to make a data visualization.  To use Seaborn on your personal computer, run "pip install seaborn" at command line.

I included some notes with my data visualization, but you need not be so exhaustive.

# Rubric

You will be assessed on whether you created a web-hosted visualization with partial credit eligibility for having code or other progress on each sub-step.  Out of 200 points.
